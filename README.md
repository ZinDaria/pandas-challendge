# Pandas Challenge
## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook script aimed at analyzing district-wide standardized test results to assist the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

PyCitySchools: This directory contains the main script PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb, which includes the analysis summary, and resources.

## Usage
Follow these steps to run the analysis:

- Navigate to the PyCitySchools directory.
- Run the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb script using Jupyter Notebook.
  
## Summary of the Analysis
The analysis is based on data from 15 high schools of both Charter and District types, with an overall budget of $24,649,428 and a total of 39,170 students. Key metrics obtained include:

Average Math Score: ~78.99
Average Reading Score: ~81.88
Math Passing Rate: ~74.98%
Reading Passing Rate: ~85.81%
Overall (Math and Reading) Passing Rate: ~65.17%
The highest performing school, Cabrera High School, has an overall pass rate of ~91.33%, while the lowest performing school, Rodriguez High School, has an overall pass rate of ~52.99%.

## Comparisons from the Calculations
Performance between grades for both math and reading across District and Charter schools shows no significant difference.
District schools exhibit a noticeable difference between math and reading scores, with math scores lower than reading scores.
Charter schools show no significant difference between average math and reading scores.
There's no significant difference in performance for District or Charter schools, regardless of budgeting.
There's a tendency indicating that lower spending per student correlates with higher overall pass rates.
District schools receive slightly higher budgeting per student but have lower overall performance compared to Charter schools.

## Conclusions from the Calculations
District schools, despite receiving higher per student budgeting and being larger in size, exhibit lower performance compared to Charter schools, especially in math scores.
